After installing the mod, you can find the Server Browser in the Online menu. From there, simply select a game and then click Connect to join up.

If the game is hosted on a third party cross-play server, we'll switch your master server automatically, even if you don't have a cross-play mod installed.

To join lobbies with custom songs, you will need MultiplayerExtensions; you will only see compatible games.


## Installation
👉 **The easiest way to install this mod is through [QuestBoard](https://www.questmodding.com/) within BMBF! The latest version of the mod *will be available there in the future.***

### Manual installation
You can manually download the latest version of the mod from the [Releases](https://github.com/EnderdracheLP/BeatSaberServerBrowserQuest/releases/latest) page. From there, download the ServerBrowser qmod file and upload it to BMBF.

*If the mod was successfully installed, you will see `Server Browser` in BMBFs `mods` Tabs.*

### Requirements
These mods are required:

- Codegen *(Core mod)*
- Custom-Types *(Core mod)*
- QuestUI *(Core mod)*


### MultiQuestensions
**I recommend installing [MultiQuestensions](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiQuestensions), which lets you play custom levels in multiplayer and adds some useful new features.** You can get the latest version through GitHub, or install it from Quest Modding wthin BMBF.

Please note, you and the host must use a compatible version of MultiQuestensions/MultiplayerExtensions. If a version difference is detected by the server browser, you will not be able to connect.

## FAQs / Troubleshooting

### Does cross-play work?
🎉 Yes! BeatTogether always allows cross play.

The Server Browser will show all games regardless of the host's platform.

### Are Quick Play servers supported?
Yes! You can now share and join Quick Play servers through the Server Browser. 

The games are only visible if someone in the lobby is announcing it to the Server Browser - Quick Play lobby data is crowd sourced!

### Do players need to be on the same game version?
Most of the time, Yes. Different versions of Beat Saber are *not always* compatible with each other for multiplayer.

The Server Browser will only show games hosted on compatible versions of the game based off of your current version.

### Will I be able to add servers to the list?
Yes, that feature is currently being worked on, the mod will be called **Lite** until then.
